0
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,150
The solver will find the nodal temperatures

1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:14,130
using a procedure similar to what we saw in the Big Ideas and in FEA.

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,150
So it&#39;ll go from the boundary value problem

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,810
to a system of algebraic equations in the nodal temperatures.

4
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:33,940
And it&#39;ll do that using the piecewise polynomial approximation for T I

5
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,190
just talked about.

6
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,040
And each algebraic equation will relate a nodal temperature to its neighbors.

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,310
For instance, if I consider this particular node, when

8
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,560
the solver derives the algebraic equation for that node,

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,410
it will relate this node to the nodal temperature.

10
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:03,180
Let&#39;s say if this is 3, it&#39;ll relate T3 to the neighboring temperature values.

11
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,300
And to see which temperatures will be related,

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,100
we can use a principle that I discussed in the Big Ideas.

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,370
So you look at all the elements that are attached to that particular node.

14
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,120
So we have four elements attached to that node.

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,690
And then you pick out all the nodes that are attached to each of those elements.

16
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,500
So this element is attached to these four nodes,

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,745
this element is attached to these four nodes.

18
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,950
And then you have these nodes coming in and these nodes,

19
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,990
which means that the algebraic equation at this node

20
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,000
will relate T3 to these other values.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,740
This node is not connected to this element,

22
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,170
so for instance, those nodes won&#39;t be involved in writing that relationship.

23
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,670
And we also know that there&#39;s going to be a constant term, that constant heat

24
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,660
generation.

25
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,470
In this case we don&#39;t have heat generation,

26
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:15,750
so the algebraic equation at this node won&#39;t contain any constant term.

27
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,180
And once the solver generates those algebraic equations-- in fact,

28
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:31,660
it thinks of fit as in the matrix form, the temperature vector, for instance,

29
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,820
in this case will be-- you know, I have 16 temperature values.

30
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,420
So this be a vector with 16 rows in one column.

31
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,370
The stiffness matrix will be a 16 by 16 matrix, and so on.

32
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,130
And similarly you can think about what&#39;s the dimension of Q?

33
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,130
And it&#39;ll invert that, so that&#39;s a matrix inversion problem,

34
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,320
and determine the nodal temperatures.

35
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,710
So you&#39;ll have the 16 nodal temperatures,

36
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,695
and everything else is calculated from those nodal temperature

37
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:04,950
through post-processing.

38
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,360
So for instance, you can find the temperature at any location

39
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,040
through the interpolation from the nodal temperatures,

40
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,860
and then you differentiate that, you can get the heat flux.

41
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,650
And the heart of the method is going from the differential equations

42
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,820
to a system of algebraic equations.

43
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,570
Let&#39;s think about how the process that we discussed in the Big Ideas and FEA

44
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,340
gets extended to the 2D case.
